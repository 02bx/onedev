covering your use of @productName@ (the "Software").  Be sure to read the
following agreement before using the Software.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE 
(REGARDLESS IF YOU HAVE GOT PERMANENT LICENSE OF THE SOFTWARE OR NOT),

business where multiple computers are located. For example, 456 Main 
Street Chicago, IL and 789 Elm Street Chicago are two different physical

located other than the purchased site. The @productName@ users 
are not restricted by physical site, and can be from anywhere. 

You may not rent or lease the Software, nor may you modify, adapt, translate, 
reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.  If you violate any 
part of this agreement, your right to use this Software terminates 
automatically and you must then destroy all copies of the Software in your 
possession.  

The Software and its related documentation are provided "AS IS" and 
without warranty of any kind and PMEase Inc. expressly disclaims all other 
warranties, expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the 
implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular

PMEase Inc. liability exceed the license fee paid, if any.
