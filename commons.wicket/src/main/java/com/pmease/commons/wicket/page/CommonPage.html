	Below html snippet is to froze the page to prevent users from clicking anything to avoid 
 	the wicket ComponentNotFoundException in case an ajax request has replaced part of the 
 	page at server side, but the page at browser side has not been updated yet. The outer 
 	div is there in order to make frozen overlay works in IE.
