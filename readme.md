### Code Discussions and Comprehensions

Instant code discussions on arbitrary block of source code or diff without creating pull requests. Discussions stay with the code to help code comprehension even if file is changed or renamed. This also works for code discussions from pull requests.

### Powerful Query Language

A powerful query language is available to execute sophisticated queries against projects, commits, builds, issues, pull requests or code comments, with auto suggestions and completions everywhere. Query can be saved for quick access later, and can be subscribed to get notified of interesting events.
